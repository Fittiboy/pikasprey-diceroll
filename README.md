# Simulating the Graveler Fights!
I felt like simulating sets of dice rolls to show how ridiculously low the odds really are to escape Pikasprey Yellow's Graveler softlock from this video: https://youtu.be/GgMl4PrdQeo

You can either download the code and run main.py in the console or if you don't know how to do that, you can go to https://pikasprey-diceroll.fitti.repl.run and hit the "run" button on top.

The code runs significantly slower on repl.run than directly in your console. So to simulate particularly large sets, you should just download/copy the code and run it on your own machine directly!
