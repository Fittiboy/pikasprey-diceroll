# Simulating the Graveler Fights!
I felt like simulating sets of dice rolls to show how ridiculously low the odds really are to escape Pikasprey Yellow's Graveler softlock from this video: https://youtu.be/GgMl4PrdQeo

You can either download the code and run it in the console or if you don't know how to do that, you can do it here: https://repl.it/@Fitti/pikasprey-diceroll 

The code runs significantly slower on repl.it than directly in your console. So to simulate particularly large sets, you should just download/copy the code and run it on your own machine directly!
